# Panel fixed effects and difference-in-differences

## Functional organization

- `panel.fit_fixed_effects`: one-way entity FE, one-way time FE, or two-way FE.
- `causal.fit_did`: treated-by-post TWFE DID with optional declared controls.
- `causal.fit_event_study`: dynamic TWFE event-time coefficients and a joint pre-trend Wald test.
- `causal.fit_staggered_did`: cohort-time ATT using never-treated or not-yet-treated controls.
- `diagnostics`: pre-specified subgroup estimation, covariance sensitivity, and placebo timing.

## Fixed effects and inference

Panel keys must be unique. Effects are absorbed by `linearmodels.PanelOLS`; they are not
silently added as reported coefficients. Covariance choices are `unadjusted`, `robust`,
`cluster_entity`, `cluster_time`, and `cluster_two_way`. Entity-clustered inference is the
default because serial dependence within a panel unit is common, but it remains explicit in
the result metadata.

## DID and event studies

`fit_did` estimates a treated-by-post interaction with entity and time fixed effects. It does
not test parallel trends by itself. `fit_event_study` omits the declared reference event time
(default -1), reports dynamic coefficients, and jointly tests the remaining pre-treatment
coefficients. Event times outside the requested window are binned into its lower or upper
endpoint so they are not silently treated as the reference category. Never-treated
observations are represented by missing `treatment_time`.

TWFE event studies can be contaminated under heterogeneous staggered treatment effects. Use
them as descriptive diagnostics in that setting, not as a substitute for cohort-time ATT.

## Staggered adoption

`fit_staggered_did` compares each treated cohort's outcome change from its last untreated
period with the same change among eligible controls. `not_yet_treated` is the default;
`never_treated` is available when a stable never-treated group exists. The first version
requires a balanced panel and reports point estimates only. It does not yet provide influence
function or bootstrap standard errors, covariate adjustment, or simultaneous confidence
bands, so confirmatory inference should wait for those additions.

Because this cohort-time estimator is currently unconditional, time-varying confounders
must not simply be ignored. Either justify unconditional parallel trends, use a pre-specified
valid adjustment before estimation, or wait for the planned doubly robust covariate-adjusted
estimator.

## Heterogeneity and robustness

Subgroup estimates require a pre-specified, time-invariant entity group and retain the same
model specification in each subgroup. Differences between subgroup point estimates are not
automatically evidence that subgroup effects differ; a formal interaction test is still
needed. Covariance sensitivity changes inference, not the estimand. Placebo dates should be
chosen from genuinely untreated periods and interpreted alongside the event-study pre-trend
test.
