# Panel fixed effects and difference-in-differences

## Functional organization

- `panel.fit_fixed_effects`: one-way entity FE, one-way time FE, or two-way FE.
- `causal.fit_did`: treated-by-post TWFE DID with optional declared controls.
- `causal.fit_event_study`: dynamic TWFE event-time coefficients and a joint pre-trend Wald test.
- `causal.fit_staggered_did_r`: research-grade `did::att_gt` group-time ATT.
- `causal.fit_sun_abraham_r`: research-grade `fixest::sunab` event study.
- `diagnostics`: formal interaction heterogeneity, covariance sensitivity, and placebo timing.

## Fixed effects and inference

Panel keys must be unique. Effects are absorbed by `linearmodels.PanelOLS`; they are not
silently added as reported coefficients. Covariance choices are `unadjusted`, `robust`,
`cluster_entity`, `cluster_time`, and `cluster_two_way`. Entity-clustered inference is the
default because serial dependence within a panel unit is common, but it remains explicit in
the result metadata.

## DID and event studies

`fit_did` estimates a treated-by-post interaction with entity and time fixed effects. It does
not test parallel trends by itself. `fit_event_study` omits the declared reference event time
(default -1), reports dynamic coefficients, and jointly tests the remaining pre-treatment
coefficients. Event times outside the requested window are binned into its lower or upper
endpoint so they are not silently treated as the reference category. Never-treated
observations are represented by missing `treatment_time`.

TWFE event studies can be contaminated under heterogeneous staggered treatment effects. Use
them as descriptive diagnostics in that setting, not as a substitute for cohort-time ATT.

`plot_data()` joins TWFE event coefficients to event-time observation counts, entity counts, and
the omitted-reference marker. It prepares a long table and does not draw a figure.

## Staggered adoption

For consequential heterogeneous staggered-adoption research, prefer the explicit R APIs above.
They provide the mature package implementations and never silently fall back. See the
[strict implementation audit](staggered_did_audit.md). The Python functions described below are
retained under `empirical_standards.experimental` as transparent educational references, not full
named-method reproductions.

Before interpreting an R-backed result, inspect every returned support and aggregation-weight
table, backend warning, reference rule, and pre-period joint test. Export these components beside
the coefficient table. Run `examples/staggered_did_r_example.py` for the complete audit pattern.

`experimental.fit_staggered_did` compares each treated cohort's outcome change from its last untreated
period with the same change among eligible controls. `not_yet_treated` is the default;
`never_treated` is available when a stable never-treated group exists. The reference reports
group-time, event-time, cohort, calendar-time, and overall ATT. Setting `bootstrap_reps` to at
least 50 enables entity-cluster bootstrap standard errors, pointwise confidence intervals,
and max-studentized simultaneous confidence bands. Use substantially more replications
(normally 999 or more) for final analysis and set `random_state` for reproducibility.

The bootstrap resamples whole entities, assigns synthetic identifiers when an entity is
drawn repeatedly, and records requested and usable replication counts. A run fails rather
than silently reporting unstable inference if fewer than 30 or 80 percent of draws are
usable. The current implementation requires a balanced panel and does not yet provide
influence-function or doubly robust covariate-adjusted inference.

Because the Python reference estimator is unconditional, time-varying confounders
must not simply be ignored. Either justify unconditional parallel trends, use a pre-specified
valid adjustment before estimation, or wait for the planned doubly robust covariate-adjusted
estimator.

## Heterogeneity and robustness

`fit_fe_heterogeneity` supplies a formal test for time-invariant categorical groups by
estimating treatment-by-group interactions, reconstructing group effects from the full
covariance matrix, and jointly testing all non-reference interactions. Covariance sensitivity
changes inference, not the estimand. Placebo dates should be
chosen from genuinely untreated periods and interpreted alongside the event-study pre-trend
test.

Subgroup-by-subgroup estimation remains available as `experimental.fit_fe_by_group` for
exploration. Differences in subgroup significance are not evidence that effects differ.
