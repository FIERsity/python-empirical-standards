# Panel fixed effects and difference-in-differences

## Functional organization

- `panel.fit_fixed_effects`: one-way entity FE, one-way time FE, or two-way FE.
- `causal.fit_did`: treated-by-post TWFE DID with optional declared controls.
- `causal.fit_event_study`: dynamic TWFE event-time coefficients and a joint pre-trend Wald test.
- `causal.fit_staggered_did`: cohort-time ATT using never-treated or not-yet-treated controls.
- `diagnostics`: pre-specified subgroup estimation, covariance sensitivity, and placebo timing.

## Fixed effects and inference

Panel keys must be unique. Effects are absorbed by `linearmodels.PanelOLS`; they are not
silently added as reported coefficients. Covariance choices are `unadjusted`, `robust`,
`cluster_entity`, `cluster_time`, and `cluster_two_way`. Entity-clustered inference is the
default because serial dependence within a panel unit is common, but it remains explicit in
the result metadata.

## DID and event studies

`fit_did` estimates a treated-by-post interaction with entity and time fixed effects. It does
not test parallel trends by itself. `fit_event_study` omits the declared reference event time
(default -1), reports dynamic coefficients, and jointly tests the remaining pre-treatment
coefficients. Event times outside the requested window are binned into its lower or upper
endpoint so they are not silently treated as the reference category. Never-treated
observations are represented by missing `treatment_time`.

TWFE event studies can be contaminated under heterogeneous staggered treatment effects. Use
them as descriptive diagnostics in that setting, not as a substitute for cohort-time ATT.

`fit_sun_abraham` estimates cohort-by-event-time interactions, omits the declared reference
period, and aggregates dynamic effects using treated cohort sizes. Its standard errors use
the full covariance matrix and the delta method. The current implementation requires a
never-treated comparison group; it does not silently substitute already-treated units.

## Staggered adoption

`fit_staggered_did` compares each treated cohort's outcome change from its last untreated
period with the same change among eligible controls. `not_yet_treated` is the default;
`never_treated` is available when a stable never-treated group exists. The estimator reports
group-time, event-time, cohort, calendar-time, and overall ATT. Setting `bootstrap_reps` to at
least 50 enables entity-cluster bootstrap standard errors, pointwise confidence intervals,
and max-studentized simultaneous confidence bands. Use substantially more replications
(normally 999 or more) for final analysis and set `random_state` for reproducibility.

The bootstrap resamples whole entities, assigns synthetic identifiers when an entity is
drawn repeatedly, and records requested and usable replication counts. A run fails rather
than silently reporting unstable inference if fewer than 30 or 80 percent of draws are
usable. The current implementation requires a balanced panel and does not yet provide
influence-function or doubly robust covariate-adjusted inference.

Because this cohort-time estimator is currently unconditional, time-varying confounders
must not simply be ignored. Either justify unconditional parallel trends, use a pre-specified
valid adjustment before estimation, or wait for the planned doubly robust covariate-adjusted
estimator.

## Heterogeneity and robustness

Subgroup estimates require a pre-specified, time-invariant entity group and retain the same
model specification in each subgroup. Differences between subgroup point estimates are not
automatically evidence that subgroup effects differ; a formal interaction test is still
needed. `fit_fe_heterogeneity` supplies that test for time-invariant categorical groups by
estimating treatment-by-group interactions, reconstructing group effects from the full
covariance matrix, and jointly testing all non-reference interactions. Covariance sensitivity
changes inference, not the estimand. Placebo dates should be
chosen from genuinely untreated periods and interpreted alongside the event-study pre-trend
test.
