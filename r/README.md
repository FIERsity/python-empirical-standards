# R backends

This directory is reserved for version-locked advanced statistical backends. Python remains the
orchestrator and shared result interface. R scripts must follow `docs/backend_policy.md`; do not
add ad hoc inline R commands or duplicate raw-data cleaning here.

The backends cover Callaway--Sant'Anna group-time effects (`did`), Sun--Abraham event studies and
high-dimensional fixed-effects IV (`fixest`), and wild-cluster inference (`fwildclusterboot`).
Their single authoritative, wheel-distributed scripts
are under `src/empirical_standards/backends/r_scripts/`, so installed and checkout behavior cannot
drift apart.

Both scripts return JSON metadata plus tidy CSV tables. The contract includes native aggregations,
confidence intervals, support and weight tables, pretrend tests, collinearity information,
warnings, and exact package versions. Restore the locked environment with
`Rscript -e 'renv::restore(project="r", prompt=FALSE)'`.
