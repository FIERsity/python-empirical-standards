  coefficients, package-native diagnostics, sample metadata, and a Python-R numerical test.
- Add an optional R `fwildclusterboot` backend for null-imposed wild-cluster inference.
- Standardize long-form plot-ready effect data without adding figure-rendering dependencies.
- Add TWFE event-time support counts and plot-ready outputs for event studies, staggered DID,
  Sun--Abraham, and Anderson-Rubin grid inversion.
- Reorganize the capability matrix, method documents, README, and Agent Skill around stable,
  experimental, and verification layers.

## 0.22.0 - 2026-07-13

- Complete the R staggered-DID contract with group-time, event, cohort, calendar, overall,
  support, aggregation-weight, point-interval, simultaneous-band, and pretrend outputs.
- Complete the R Sun--Abraham contract with disaggregated cohort-event effects, event/cohort/ATT
  aggregation, confidence intervals, support weights, pretrend tests, collinearity, and warnings.

  Agent Skill guidance for staggered-treatment designs.
